Statichunt is an open-source directory that enlists hundreds of themes, starters, and resources for static site generators submitted by the community.

## The Journey Towards Statichunt

I bought the <a href="https://statichunt.com/" target="_blank" >statichunt.com</a> domain in 2018 with the intention of creating something for the static ecosystem. Back at that time, I had no such plan to make it a real platform but I kept myself engaged working for this site. The domain was kept up to date, and gradually it swiftly became an ideal platform.

Parallelly I started working with Hugo and putting all my hard work and efforts together I built another new brand named <a href="https://gethugothemes.com/" target="_blank">Gethugothemes</a>. No Wonder my love for making unique and creative themes is beyond my imagination sometimes. However, The site was gradually progressing along with the roadmap and within a very short time it stood out in a flattering way in the Hugo industry (a prominent static site generator). Not to mention one of the main inspirations that worked behind establishing this site was to raise community awareness of the brand's importance.

I thought, why develop a comparable solution when a market pioneer is already available? Our conclusion was straightforward: Jamstack themes, starters, and resources were never shared on a single platform. Our main goal was to work more successfully with Jamstack. As a result, we redesigned the platform and consolidated all of the high-quality resources.

My team's consistent labor was gradually bearing fruit. All of the themes and materials in Statichunt were gathered with quality in mind. Developers may now easily create Jamstack projects. As a result, members of the community and users are eager to contribute to this platform. Currently, my goal is to extend the contribution to the point where individuals may learn and produce ideas using Statichunt.
