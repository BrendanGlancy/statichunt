## Theme features

* **Dual context: LibDoc + Playground**<br> LibDoc was made to craft documentation with its own embedded demos and examples. A major feature of the LibDoc Jekyll theme is its own built-in and configurable playground which is both a [layout](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-layouts.html#playground) and a syntax highlighter extension. It extends the [syntax highlighter](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-config.html#prismjs-syntax-highlighter) by running the specified code into a configurable context with user defined style sheets and scripts.
