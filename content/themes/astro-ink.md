## Theme Features

- Minimal, Crisp, Markdown-Blog Ready

- The structure is highly modular, with components doing just one job, and one job well.
- It's ready with Next.js like dynamic pages, to support a tag-based classification system with paginated results, all configurable
- Dark Mode & Color Codes
- Future Posts Feature
- Allow your users get to your blog posts quickly with client-side search feat. Lunr.js
