## Theme Features
- Responsive and streamlined design.
- Gatsby compiles the blog into HTML+CSS+JS so hosting the blog costs nothing at CDNs like Netlify.
- Blazing fast UX
- Autogenerated tracedSVG image placeholders
- Write blog posts into Markdown files 
- Expandable: possible to embed custom React components into Markdown.
- Posts organized by tags.
- Teasers of posts are generated to front page with infinite scroll which gracefully degrades into pagination.
- Allow readers to be notified of updates with RSS feed and email newsletter.
- Hero section with animated 3D WebGL art.
- Contact Form.
